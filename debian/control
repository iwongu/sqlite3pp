Description: SQLite3++ shared library
 SQLite3++ is C++ wrapper of SQLite3 API. It supports almost all of SQLite3
 features using C++ classes such as database, command, query, and transaction.
 The query class supports iterator concept for fetching records. With
 ext::function class, it's also easy to write the sqlite3's functions and
 aggregations.
